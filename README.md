# Project Selection Tool (PST)

A web-based Project Selection Tool (PST) designed for university students and tutors to streamline the final-year project selection process. This tool allows tutors to post available projects, track student interest, and assign projects effectively, while enabling students to submit their preferences and propose their own projects.

Key Features
Project Creation & Management: Tutors can create, edit, and manage projects, set prerequisites, and define project-specific details.
Student Project Selection: Students can explore projects, submit preferences, and propose their own projects with faculty review.
Role-based Access: Separate views and privileges for students, tutors, and administrators for enhanced workflow.
Project Filtering & Assignment: Tutors can review student applications and assign projects, with filtering options for optimal matching.
Admin Controls: Administrators have a full view of the platform, including proposal approvals, project analytics, and user management.
Insights Dashboard: Data-driven dashboards for tutors and admins to track project engagement, trends, and application statistics.
This repository contains the codebase for the PST project, using NestJS for the backend, TypeORM for database management, and an integrated front end for a seamless user experience.
